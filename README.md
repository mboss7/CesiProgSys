## Project description : 

The team has to develop a backup software called EasySave for the software publisher ProSoft. The software will be sold at 200 € HT with an annual maintenance contract at 12% of the purchase price. The team must respect constraints concerning the development tools and methods, the language used, the readability of the code and the user documentation. The project must also be managed in such a way as to reduce the development costs of future versions and to guarantee rapid reactivity in the event of a malfunction.
